# Mech Interp Research
 This is a place where I'll keep some of the various research projects I've been juggling.


 Multimeter -- Is working I'm doing in collobration with my professor and MIT CSAIL. The idea is to explore if we can heuristically detect feature representation with transfer learning. 

 Var-Sae -- I'm annoyed by the fixed size SAE methods. So this is my way around it.
